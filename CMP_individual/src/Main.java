// student enrollment system is automating and streamlining the process of enrolling students
// into courses or programs. Instead of manually collecting and processing enrollment information,
// the system allows students to register online, enter their details, and select the desired courses.
//This helps in reducing paperwork, improving efficiency,
// and providing a convenient enrollment experience for both students and administrators.
